# Aix Project

The aim of this project is provide a tool for programing microcontrollers in a modern language but allowing compiling code even in low-resource devices. This project is composed by 3 main componentes:

- The **Aixt** programing language based on the [_V language_](https://vlang.io/) syntax.
- The **Aixt to C Transpiler**, which translate de **Aixt** source code to C, for the expecific C compiler of each microcontroller.
- The **Aixt API**, which makes the programming easy by standardizing the setup and I/O functions.
